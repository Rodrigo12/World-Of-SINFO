![THE GAME](https://github.com/Rodrigo12/World-Of-SINFO/blob/master/assets/banner.png)

World of SINFO was one of the first games that I developed, and the only one using the Phaser framework. This game main characters are the speakers and members of SINFO XXI, a university organization. The player's goal is to overcome several levels without dying. To conclude each level the player need to surpass the corresponding speaker that is shooting objects into the air. The player lives are the  number of member of SINFO in that year.
